					*backtick-expansion* *`-expansion*
On Unix and a few other systems you can also use backticks for the file name
argument, for example: >
	:next `find . -name ver\\*.c -print`
	:view `ls -t *.patch  \| head -n1`
The backslashes before the star are required to prevent the shell from
expanding "ver*.c" prior to execution of the find program.  The backslash
before the shell pipe symbol "|" prevents Vim from parsing it as command
termination.
This also works for most other systems, with the restriction that the
backticks must be around the whole item.  It is not possible to have text
directly before the first or just after the last backtick.
