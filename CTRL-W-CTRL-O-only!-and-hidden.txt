		Make the current window the only one on the screen.  All other
		windows are closed.  For {count} see |:quit| command.
		
		When the 'hidden' option is set, all buffers in closed windows
		become hidden.
		
		When 'hidden' is not set, and the 'autowrite' option is set,
		modified buffers are written.  Otherwise, windows that have
		buffers that are modified are not removed, unless the [!] is
		given, then they become hidden.  But modified buffers are
		never abandoned, so changes cannot get lost.
