*41.3*	Expressions

Vim has a rich, yet simple way to handle expressions.  You can read the
definition here: |expression-syntax|.  Here we will show the most common
items.
   The numbers, strings and variables mentioned above are expressions by
themselves.  Thus everywhere an expression is expected, you can use a number,
string or variable.  Other basic items in an expression are:

	$NAME		environment variable
	&name		option
	@r		register

Examples: >

	:echo "The value of 'tabstop' is" &ts
	:echo "Your home directory is" $HOME
	:if @a > 5

The &name form can be used to save an option value, set it to a new value,
do something and restore the old value.  Example: >

	:let save_ic = &ic
	:set noic
	:/The Start/,$delete
	:let &ic = save_ic
