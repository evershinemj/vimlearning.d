If you like tcsh's autolist completion, you can use this mapping:
	:cnoremap X <C-L><C-D>
(Where X is the command key to use, <C-L> is CTRL-L and <C-D> is CTRL-D)
This will find the longest match and then list all matching files.

If you like tcsh's autolist completion, you can use the 'wildmode' option to
emulate it.  For example, this mimics autolist=ambiguous:
	:set wildmode=longest,list
This will find the longest match with the first 'wildchar', then list all
matching files with the next.
