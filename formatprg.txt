			{not in Vi}
	The name of an external program that will be used to format the lines
	selected with the |gq| operator.  The program must take the input on
	stdin and produce the output on stdout.  The Unix program "fmt" is
	such a program.
	If the 'formatexpr' option is not empty it will be used instead.
	Otherwise, if 'formatprg' option is an empty string, the internal
	format function will be used |C-indenting|.
	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
	about including spaces and backslashes.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
