matchstr({expr}, {pat} [, {start} [, {count}]])			*matchstr()*
		Same as |match()|, but return the matched string.  Example: >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing")
<		results in "ing".
		When there is no match "" is returned.
		The {start}, if given, has the same meaning as for |match()|. >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 2)
<		results in "ing". >
			:echo matchstr("testing", "ing", 5)
<		result is "".
		When {expr} is a |List| then the matching item is returned.
		The type isn't changed, it's not necessarily a String.
