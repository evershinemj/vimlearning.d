						*'spellfile'* *'spf'*
'spellfile' 'spf'	string	(default empty)
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+syntax|
			feature}
	Name of the word list file where words are added for the |zg| and |zw|
	commands.  It must end in ".{encoding}.add".  You need to include the
	path, otherwise the file is placed in the current directory.
								*E765*
	It may also be a comma separated list of names.  A count before the
	|zg| and |zw| commands can be used to access each.  This allows using
	a personal word list file and a project word list file.
	When a word is added while this option is empty Vim will set it for
	you: Using the first directory in 'runtimepath' that is writable.  If
	there is no "spell" directory yet it will be created.  For the file
	name the first language name that appears in 'spelllang' is used,
	ignoring the region.
	The resulting ".spl" file will be used for spell checking, it does not
	have to appear in 'spelllang'.
	Normally one file is used for all regions, but you can add the region
	name if you want to.  However, it will then only be used when
	'spellfile' is set to it, for entries in 'spelllang' only files
	without region name will be found.
	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
	security reasons.
