DEFINING BREAKPOINTS
							*:breaka* *:breakadd*
:breaka[dd] func [lnum] {name}
		Set a breakpoint in a function.  Example: >
			:breakadd func Explore
<		Doesn't check for a valid function name, thus the breakpoint
		can be set before the function is defined.

:breaka[dd] file [lnum] {name}
		Set a breakpoint in a sourced file.  Example: >
			:breakadd file 43 .vimrc

:breaka[dd] here
		Set a breakpoint in the current line of the current file.
		Like doing: >
			:breakadd file <cursor-line> <current-file>
<		Note that this only works for commands that are executed when
		sourcing the file, not for a function defined in that file.

The [lnum] is the line number of the breakpoint.  Vim will stop at or after
this line.  When omitted line 1 is used.
