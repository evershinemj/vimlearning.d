							*>cont*
	cont		Continue execution until the next breakpoint is hit.
							*>quit*
	quit		Abort execution.  This is like using CTRL-C, some
			things might still be executed, doesn't abort
			everything.  Still stops at the next breakpoint.
							*>next*
	next		Execute the command and come back to debug mode when
			it's finished.  This steps over user function calls
			and sourced files.
							*>step*
	step		Execute the command and come back to debug mode for
			the next command.  This steps into called user
			functions and sourced files.
							*>interrupt*
	interrupt	This is like using CTRL-C, but unlike ">quit" comes
			back to debug mode for the next command that is
			executed.  Useful for testing |:finally| and |:catch|
			on interrupt exceptions.
							*>finish*
	finish		Finish the current script or user function and come
			back to debug mode for the command after the one that
			sourced or called it.
							*>bt*
							*>backtrace*
							*>where*
	backtrace	Show the call stacktrace for current debugging session.
	bt
	where
							*>frame*
	frame N		Goes to N backtrace level. + and - signs make movement
			relative.  E.g., ":frame +3" goes three frames up.
							*>up*
	up		Goes one level up from call stacktrace.
							*>down*
	down		Goes one level down from call stacktrace.

About the additional commands in debug mode:
- There is no command-line completion for them, you get the completion for the
  normal Ex commands only.
- You can shorten them, up to a single character, unless more than one command
  starts with the same letter.  "f" stands for "finish", use "fr" for "frame".
- Hitting <CR> will repeat the previous one.  When doing another command, this
  is reset (because it's not clear what you want to repeat).
- When you want to use the Ex command with the same name, prepend a colon:
  ":cont", ":next", ":finish" (or shorter).

The backtrace shows the hierarchy of function calls, e.g.:
	>bt ~
	  3 function One[3] ~
	  2 Two[3] ~
	->1 Three[3] ~
	  0 Four ~
	line 1: let four = 4 ~

The "->" points to the current frame.  Use "up", "down" and "frame N" to
select another frame.

In the current frame you can evaluate the local function variables.  There is
no way to see the command at the current line yet.
