USING A RANGE

The ":call" command can be given a line range.  This can have one of two
meanings.  When a function has been defined with the "range" keyword, it will
take care of the line range itself.
  The function will be passed the variables "a:firstline" and "a:lastline".
These will have the line numbers from the range the function was called with.
Example: >

	:function Count_words() range
	:  let lnum = a:firstline
	:  let n = 0
	:  while lnum <= a:lastline
	:    let n = n + len(split(getline(lnum)))
	:    let lnum = lnum + 1
	:  endwhile
	:  echo "found " . n . " words"
	:endfunction

You can call this function with: >

	:10,30call Count_words()

It will be executed once and echo the number of words.
   The other way to use a line range is by defining a function without the
"range" keyword.  The function will be called once for every line in the
range, with the cursor in that line.  Example: >

	:function  Number()
	:  echo "line " . line(".") . " contains: " . getline(".")
	:endfunction

If you call this function with: >

	:10,15call Number()

The function will be called six times.
