strpart({src}, {start} [, {len}])			*strpart()*
		The result is a String, which is part of {src}, starting from
		byte {start}, with the byte length {len}.
		To count characters instead of bytes use |strcharpart()|.

		When bytes are selected which do not exist, this doesn't
		result in an error, the bytes are simply omitted.
		If {len} is missing, the copy continues from {start} till the
		end of the {src}. >
