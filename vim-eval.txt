If you don't want to execute a string but evaluate it to get its expression
value, you can use the eval() function: >

	:let optname = "path"
	:let optval = eval('&' . optname)

A "&" character is prepended to "path", thus the argument to eval() is
"&path".  The result will then be the value of the 'path' option.
   The same thing can be done with: >
	:exe 'let optval = &' . optname
