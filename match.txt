match({expr}, {pat} [, {start} [, {count}]])			*match()*
		When {expr} is a |List| then this returns the index of the
		first item where {pat} matches.  Each item is used as a
		String, |Lists| and |Dictionaries| are used as echoed.
		Otherwise, {expr} is used as a String.  The result is a
		Number, which gives the index (byte offset) in {expr} where
		{pat} matches.
		A match at the first character or |List| item returns zero.
		If there is no match -1 is returned.
		For getting submatches see |matchlist()|.
		Example: >
			:echo match("testing", "ing")	" results in 4
			:echo match([1, 'x'], '\a')	" results in 1
<		See |string-match| for how {pat} is used.
