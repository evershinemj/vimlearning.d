1. Defining digraphs					*digraphs-define*

						*:dig* *:digraphs*
:dig[raphs]		show currently defined digraphs.
							*E104* *E39*
:dig[raphs] {char1}{char2} {number} ...
			Add digraph {char1}{char2} to the list.  {number} is
			the decimal representation of the character.  Normally
			it is the Unicode character, see |digraph-encoding|.
			Example: >
	:digr e: 235 a: 228
<			Avoid defining a digraph with '_' (underscore) as the
			first character, it has a special meaning in the
			future.

Vim is normally compiled with the |+digraphs| feature.  If the feature is
disabled, the ":digraph" command will display an error message.

Example of the output of ":digraphs": >
 TH Þ  222  ss ß  223  a! à  224  a' á  225  a> â  226  a? ã  227  a: ä  228

The first two characters in each column are the characters you have to type to
enter the digraph.

In the middle of each column is the resulting character.  This may be mangled
if you look at it on a system that does not support digraphs or if you print
this file.
