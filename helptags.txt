:helpt[ags] [++t] {dir}
			Generate the help tags file(s) for directory {dir}.
			When {dir} is ALL then all "doc" directories in
			'runtimepath' will be used.

			All "*.txt" and "*.??x" files in the directory and
			sub-directories are scanned for a help tag definition
			in between stars.  The "*.??x" files are for
			translated docs, they generate the "tags-??" file, see
			|help-translated|.  The generated tags files are
			sorted.
			When there are duplicates an error message is given.
			An existing tags file is silently overwritten.

			The optional "++t" argument forces adding the
			"help-tags" tag.  This is also done when the {dir} is
			equal to $VIMRUNTIME/doc.
