Dependencies between plugins ~
							*packload-two-steps*
Suppose you have two plugins that depend on the same functionality. You can
put the common functionality in an autoload directory, so that it will be
found automatically.  Your package would have these files:

	pack/foo/start/one/plugin/one.vim  >
		call foolib#getit()
<	pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vim >
		call foolib#getit()
<	pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vim >
		func foolib#getit()

This works, because loading packages will first add all found directories to
'runtimepath' before sourcing the plugins.
