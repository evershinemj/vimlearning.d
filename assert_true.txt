assert_true({actual} [, {msg}])				*assert_true()*
		When {actual} is not true an error message is added to
		|v:errors|, like with |assert_equal()|.
		A value is TRUE when it is a non-zero number.  When {actual}
		is not a number the assert fails.
		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form "Expected True but
		got {actual}" is produced.
