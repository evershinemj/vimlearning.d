The 'comments' option is a comma-separated list of parts.  Each part defines a
type of comment string.  A part consists of:
	{flags}:{string}

{string} is the literal text that must appear.

{flags}:
  n	Nested comment.  Nesting with mixed parts is allowed.  If 'comments'
	is "n:),n:>" a line starting with "> ) >" is a comment.

  b	Blank (<Space>, <Tab> or <EOL>) required after {string}.

  f	Only the first line has the comment string.  Do not repeat comment on
	the next line, but preserve indentation (e.g., a bullet-list).

  s	Start of three-piece comment

  m	Middle of a three-piece comment

  e	End of a three-piece comment

  l	Left align. Used together with 's' or 'e', the leftmost character of
	start or end will line up with the leftmost character from the middle.
	This is the default and can be omitted. See below for more details.

  r	Right align. Same as above but rightmost instead of leftmost. See
	below for more details.

  O	Don't consider this comment for the "O" command.

  x	Allows three-piece comments to be ended by just typing the last
	character of the end-comment string as the first action on a new
	line when the middle-comment string has been inserted automatically.
	See below for more details.

  {digits}
	When together with 's' or 'e': add {digit} amount of offset to an
	automatically inserted middle or end comment leader. The offset begins
	from a left alignment. See below for more details.

  -{digits}
	Like {digits} but reduce the indent.  This only works when there is
	some indent for the start or end part that can be removed.
