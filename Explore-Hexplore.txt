						*netrw-:Explore*
:Explore  will open the local-directory browser on the current file's
          directory (or on directory [dir] if specified).  The window will be
	  split only if the file has been modified and |'hidden'| is not set,
	  otherwise the browsing window will take over that window.  Normally
	  the splitting is taken horizontally.
	  Also see: |netrw-:Rexplore|
:Explore! is like :Explore, but will use vertical splitting.

						*netrw-:Hexplore*
:Hexplore  [dir] does an :Explore with |:belowright| horizontal splitting.
:Hexplore! [dir] does an :Explore with |:aboveleft|  horizontal splitting.
