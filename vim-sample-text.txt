vim: set textwidth=60 filetype=vim list:
" use set list in modeline if you want to see
" special variables in a specific file

" set list listchars?
" note that trail:@ in listchars means that only trailing
" whitespace is shown with '@', not every whitespace!
" this is why in insert mode typing a trailing space results
" in '@' temporarily shown, which soon disappears since the
" next typed char makes the space not trailing any more

use set list! to toggle the list bool, so you can use
@: to toggle again
set list makes <Space><Tab> rendered as ' t~~~~~~'
 	this is a sample text file
