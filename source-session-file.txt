   The following command creates a session file: >

	:mksession vimbook.vim

Later if you want to restore this session, you can use this command: >

	:source vimbook.vim

If you want to start Vim and restore a specific session, you can use the
following command: >

	vim -S vimbook.vim

This tells Vim to read a specific file on startup.  The 'S' stands for
session (actually, you can source any Vim script with -S, thus it might as
well stand for "source").
