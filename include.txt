						*'include'* *'inc'*
'include' 'inc'		string	(default "^\s*#\s*include")
			global or local to buffer |global-local|
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| feature}
	Pattern to be used to find an include command.  It is a search
	pattern, just like for the "/" command (See |pattern|).  The default
	value is for C programs.  This option is used for the commands "[i",
	"]I", "[d", etc.
	Normally the 'isfname' option is used to recognize the file name that
	comes after the matched pattern.  But if "\zs" appears in the pattern
	then the text matched from "\zs" to the end, or until "\ze" if it
	appears, is used as the file name.  Use this to include characters
	that are not in 'isfname', such as a space.  You can then use
	'includeexpr' to process the matched text.
	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
