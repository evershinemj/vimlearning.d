						*location-list* *E776*
A location list is a window-local quickfix list. You get one after commands
like `:lvimgrep`, `:lgrep`, `:lhelpgrep`, `:lmake`, etc., which create a
location list instead of a quickfix list as the corresponding `:vimgrep`,
`:grep`, `:helpgrep`, `:make` do.
A location list is associated with a window and each window can have a
separate location list.  A location list can be associated with only one
window.  The location list is independent of the quickfix list.

When a window with a location list is split, the new window gets a copy of the
location list.  When there are no longer any references to a location list,
the location list is destroyed.

The following quickfix commands can be used.  The location list commands are
similar to the quickfix commands, replacing the 'c' prefix in the quickfix
command with 'l'.
