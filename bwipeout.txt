		Like |:bdelete|, but really delete the buffer.  Everything
		related to the buffer is lost.  All marks in this buffer
		become invalid, option settings are lost, etc.  Don't use this
		unless you know what you are doing. Examples: >
		    :.+,$bwipeout   " wipe out all buffers after the current
				    " one
		    :%bwipeout	    " wipe out all buffers
