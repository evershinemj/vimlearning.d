							*zd* *E351*
zd		Delete one fold at the cursor.  When the cursor is on a folded
		line, that fold is deleted.  Nested folds are moved one level
		up.  In Visual mode one level of all folds (partially) in the
		selected area are deleted.
		Careful: This easily deletes more folds than you expect and
		there is no undo for manual folding.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.

							*zD*
zD		Delete folds recursively at the cursor.  In Visual mode all
		folds (partially) in the selected area and all nested folds in
		them are deleted.
		This only works when 'foldmethod' is "manual" or "marker".
		Also see |fold-delete-marker|.
