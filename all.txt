:[N]sal[l][!] [N]
		Rearrange the screen to open one window for each argument.
		All other windows are closed.  When a count is given, this is
		the maximum number of windows to open.
		With the |:tab| modifier open a tab page for each argument.
		When there are more arguments than 'tabpagemax' further ones
		become split windows in the last tab page.
		When the 'hidden' option is set, all buffers in closed windows
		become hidden.
		When 'hidden' is not set, and the 'autowrite' option is set,
		modified buffers are written.  Otherwise, windows that have
		buffers that are modified are not removed, unless the [!] is
		given, then they become hidden.  But modified buffers are
		never abandoned, so changes cannot get lost.
		[N] is the maximum number of windows to open.  'winheight'
		also limits the number of windows opened ('winwidth' if
		|:vertical| was prepended).
		Buf/Win Enter/Leave autocommands are not executed for the new
		windows here, that's only done when they are really entered.
