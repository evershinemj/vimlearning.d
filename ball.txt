:[N]sba[ll] [N]	Rearrange the screen to open one window for each buffer in
		the buffer list.  When a count is given, this is the maximum
		number of windows to open.  'winheight' also limits the number
		of windows opened ('winwidth' if |:vertical| was prepended).
		Buf/Win Enter/Leave autocommands are not executed for the new
		windows here, that's only done when they are really entered.
		When the |:tab| modifier is used new windows are opened in a
		new tab, up to 'tabpagemax'.
