								*gn* *v_gn*
gn			Search forward for the last used search pattern, like
			with `n`, and start Visual mode to select the match.
			If the cursor is on the match, visually selects it.
			If an operator is pending, operates on the match.
			E.g., "dgn" deletes the text of the next match.
			If Visual mode is active, extends the selection
			until the end of the next match.
			Note: Unlike `n` the search direction does not depend
			on the previous search command.
