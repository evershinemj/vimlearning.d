							*assert_equal()*
assert_equal({expected}, {actual} [, {msg}])
		When {expected} and {actual} are not equal an error message is
		added to |v:errors|.
		There is no automatic conversion, the String "4" is different
		from the Number 4.  And the number 4 is different from the
		Float 4.0.  The value of 'ignorecase' is not used here, case
		always matters.
		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form "Expected
		{expected} but got {actual}" is produced.
		Example: >
	assert_equal('foo', 'bar')
<		Will result in a string to be added to |v:errors|:
	test.vim line 12: Expected 'foo' but got 'bar' ~
