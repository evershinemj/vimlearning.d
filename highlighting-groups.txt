For the GUI you can use the following groups to set the colors for the menu,
scrollbars and tooltips.  They don't have defaults.  This doesn't work for the
Win32 GUI.  Only three highlight arguments have any effect here: font, guibg,
and guifg.

							*hl-Menu*
Menu		Current font, background and foreground colors of the menus.
		Also used for the toolbar.
		Applicable highlight arguments: font, guibg, guifg.

		NOTE: For Motif and Athena the font argument actually
		specifies a fontset at all times, no matter if 'guifontset' is
		empty, and as such it is tied to the current |:language| when
		set.

							*hl-Scrollbar*
Scrollbar	Current background and foreground of the main window's
		scrollbars.
		Applicable highlight arguments: guibg, guifg.

							*hl-Tooltip*
Tooltip		Current font, background and foreground of the tooltips.

		NOTE: For Motif and Athena the font argument actually
		specifies a fontset at all times, no matter if 'guifontset' is
		empty, and as such it is tied to the current |:language| when
		set.
