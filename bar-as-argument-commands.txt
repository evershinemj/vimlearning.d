These commands see the '|' as their argument, and can therefore not be
followed by another Vim command:
    :argdo
    :autocmd
    :bufdo
    :cdo
    :cfdo
    :command
    :cscope
    :debug
    :folddoopen
    :folddoclosed
    :function
    :global
    :help
    :helpfind
    :lcscope
    :ldo
    :lfdo
    :make
    :normal
    :perl
    :perldo
    :promptfind
    :promptrepl
    :pyfile
    :python
    :registers
    :read !
    :scscope
    :sign
    :tcl
    :tcldo
    :tclfile
    :vglobal
    :windo
    :write !
    :[range]!
    a user defined command without the "-bar" argument |:command|

Note that this is confusing (inherited from Vi): With ":g" the '|' is included
in the command, with ":s" it is not.
