					*:hi-default* *:highlight-default*
The [default] argument is used for setting the default highlighting for a
group.	If highlighting has already been specified for the group the command
will be ignored.  Also when there is an existing link.

Using [default] is especially useful to overrule the highlighting of a
specific syntax file.  For example, the C syntax file contains: >
	:highlight default link cComment Comment
If you like Question highlighting for C comments, put this in your vimrc file: >
	:highlight link cComment Question
Without the "default" in the C syntax file, the highlighting would be
overruled when the syntax file is loaded.
