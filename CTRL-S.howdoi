Ctrl+S is a common command to terminals to stop updating, it was a way to slow the output so you could read it on terminals that didn't have a scrollback buffer.  First find out if you can [configure your xterm](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Map_Ctrl-S_to_save_current_or_new_files) to pass Ctrl+S through to the application.  Then these map commands will work:
noremap <silent> <C-S>          :update<CR>
vnoremap <silent> <C-S>         <C-C>:update<CR>
inoremap <silent> <C-S>         <C-O>:update<CR>

BTW: if Ctrl+S freezes your terminal, type Ctrl+Q to get it going again.
