:[N]bun[load][!]				*:bun* *:bunload* *E515*
:bun[load][!] [N]
		Unload buffer [N] (default: current buffer).  The memory
		allocated for this buffer will be freed.  The buffer remains
		in the buffer list.
		If the buffer was changed, this fails, unless when [!] is
		specified, in which case the changes are lost.
		Any windows for this buffer are closed.  If buffer [N] is the
		current buffer, another buffer will be displayed instead.
		This is the most recent entry in the jump list that points
		into a loaded buffer.

:bunload[!] {bufname}
		Like ":bunload[!] [N]", but buffer given by name.  Note that a
		buffer whose name is a number cannot be referenced by that
		name; use the buffer number instead.  Insert a backslash
		before a space in a buffer name.

:N,Mbunload[!]	Do ":bunload[!]" for all buffers in the range N to M
		|inclusive|.

:bunload[!] N1 N2 ...
		Do ":bunload[!]" for buffer N1, N2, etc.  The arguments can be
		buffer numbers or buffer names (but not buffer names that are
		a number).  Insert a backslash before a space in a buffer
		name.
