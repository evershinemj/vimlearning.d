'backupext' 'bex'	string	(default "~", for VMS: "_")
			global
			{not in Vi}
	String which is appended to a file name to make the name of the
	backup file.  The default is quite unusual, because this avoids
	accidentally overwriting existing files with a backup file.  You might
	prefer using ".bak", but make sure that you don't have files with
	".bak" that you want to keep.
	Only normal file name characters can be used, "/\*?[|<>" are illegal.

	If you like to keep a lot of backups, you could use a BufWritePre
	autocommand to change 'backupext' just before writing the file to
	include a timestamp. >
		:au BufWritePre * let &bex = '-' . strftime("%Y%b%d%X") . '~'
<	Use 'backupdir' to put the backup in a different directory.
