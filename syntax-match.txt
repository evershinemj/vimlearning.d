*44.3*	Matches

Consider defining something a bit more complex.  You want to match ordinary
identifiers.  To do this, you define a match syntax item.  This one matches
any word consisting of only lowercase letters: >

	:syntax match xIdentifier /\<\l\+\>/
<
	Note:
	Keywords overrule any other syntax item.  Thus the keywords "if",
	"then", etc., will be keywords, as defined with the ":syntax keyword"
	commands above, even though they also match the pattern for
	xIdentifier.

The part at the end is a pattern, like it's used for searching.  The // is
used to surround the pattern (like how it's done in a ":substitute" command).
You can use any other character, like a plus or a quote.

Now define a match for a comment.  In the x language it is anything from # to
the end of a line: >

	:syntax match xComment /#.*/

Since you can use any search pattern, you can highlight very complex things
with a match item.  See |pattern| for help on search patterns.
