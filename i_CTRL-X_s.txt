Spelling suggestions					*compl-spelling*

A word before or at the cursor is located and correctly spelled words are
suggested to replace it.  If there is a badly spelled word in the line, before
or under the cursor, the cursor is moved to after it.  Otherwise the word just
before the cursor is used for suggestions, even though it isn't badly spelled.

NOTE: CTRL-S suspends display in many Unix terminals.  Use 's' instead.  Type
CTRL-Q to resume displaying.
