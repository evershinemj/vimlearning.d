	The defaults for most systems are setup to search five locations:
	1. In your home directory, for your personal preferences.
	2. In a system-wide Vim directory, for preferences from the system
	   administrator.
	3. In $VIMRUNTIME, for files distributed with Vim.
							*after-directory*
	4. In the "after" directory in the system-wide Vim directory.  This is
	   for the system administrator to overrule or add to the distributed
	   defaults (rarely needed)
	5. In the "after" directory in your home directory.  This is for
	   personal preferences to overrule or add to the distributed defaults
	   or system-wide settings (rarely needed).
