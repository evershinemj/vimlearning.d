:ts[elect][!] [ident]	List the tags that match [ident], using the
			information in the tags file(s).
			When [ident] is not given, the last tag name from the
			tag stack is used.
			See |tag-!| for [!].
			With a '>' in the first column is indicated which is
			the current position in the list (if there is one).
			[ident] can be a regexp pattern, see |tag-regexp|.
			See |tag-priority| for the priorities used in the
			listing.  {not in Vi}
			Example output:

>
	 nr pri kind tag		file
	  1 F	f    mch_delay		os_amiga.c
			mch_delay(msec, ignoreinput)
	> 2 F	f    mch_delay		os_msdos.c
			mch_delay(msec, ignoreinput)
	  3 F	f    mch_delay		os_unix.c
			mch_delay(msec, ignoreinput)
	Enter nr of choice (<CR> to abort):
<
			See |tag-priority| for the "pri" column.  Note that
			this depends on the current file, thus using
			":tselect xxx" can produce different results.
			The "kind" column gives the kind of tag, if this was
			included in the tags file.
			The "info" column shows information that could be
			found in the tags file.  It depends on the program
			that produced the tags file.
			When the list is long, you may get the |more-prompt|.
			If you already see the tag you want to use, you can
			type 'q' and enter the number.
