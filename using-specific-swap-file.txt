USING A SPECIFIC SWAP FILE

If you know which swap file needs to be used, you can recover by giving the
swap file name.  Vim will then finds out the name of the original file from
the swap file.

Example: >
	vim -r .help.txt.swo

This is also handy when the swap file is in another directory than expected.
Vim recognizes files with the pattern *.s[uvw][a-z] as swap files.

If this still does not work, see what file names Vim reports and rename the
files accordingly.  Check the 'directory' option to see where Vim may have
put the swap file.

	Note:
	Vim tries to find the swap file by searching the directories in the
	'dir' option, looking for files that match "filename.sw?".  If
	wildcard expansion doesn't work (e.g., when the 'shell' option is
	invalid), Vim does a desperate try to find the file "filename.swp".
	If that fails too, you will have to give the name of the swapfile
	itself to be able to recover the file.
