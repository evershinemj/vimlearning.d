*44.5*	Nested items

Take a look at this comment:

	%Get input  TODO: Skip white space ~

You want to highlight TODO in big yellow letters, even though it is in a
comment that is highlighted blue.  To let Vim know about this, you define the
following syntax groups: >

	:syntax keyword xTodo TODO contained
	:syntax match xComment /%.*/ contains=xTodo

In the first line, the "contained" argument tells Vim that this keyword can
exist only inside another syntax item.  The next line has "contains=xTodo".
This indicates that the xTodo syntax element is inside it.  The result is that
the comment line as a whole is matched with "xComment" and made blue.  The
word TODO inside it is matched by xTodo and highlighted yellow (highlighting
for xTodo was setup for this).
