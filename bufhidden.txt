The 'hidden' is global, it is used for all buffers.  The 'bufhidden' option
can be used to make an exception for a specific buffer.  It can take these
values:
	<empty>		Use the value of 'hidden'.
	hide		Hide this buffer, also when 'hidden' is not set.
	unload		Don't hide but unload this buffer, also when 'hidden'
			is set.
	delete		Delete the buffer.
