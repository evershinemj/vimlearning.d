5. Moving windows around				*window-moving*

CTRL-W r				*CTRL-W_r* *CTRL-W_CTRL-R* *E443*
CTRL-W CTRL-R	Rotate windows downwards/rightwards.  The first window becomes
		the second one, the second one becomes the third one, etc.
		The last window becomes the first window.  The cursor remains
		in the same window.
		This only works within the row or column of windows that the
		current window is in.

						*CTRL-W_R*
CTRL-W R	Rotate windows upwards/leftwards.  The second window becomes
		the first one, the third one becomes the second one, etc.  The
		first window becomes the last window.  The cursor remains in
		the same window.
		This only works within the row or column of windows that the
		current window is in.

CTRL-W x					*CTRL-W_x* *CTRL-W_CTRL-X*
CTRL-W CTRL-X	Without count: Exchange current window with next one.  If there
		is no next window, exchange with previous window.
		With count: Exchange current window with Nth window (first
		window is 1).  The cursor is put in the other window.
		When vertical and horizontal window splits are mixed, the
		exchange is only done in the row or column of windows that the
		current window is in.

The following commands can be used to change the window layout.  For example,
when there are two vertically split windows, CTRL-W K will change that in
horizontally split windows.  CTRL-W H does it the other way around.

						*CTRL-W_K*
CTRL-W K	Move the current window to be at the very top, using the full
		width of the screen.  This works like closing the current
		window and then creating another one with ":topleft split",
		except that the current window contents is used for the new
		window.

						*CTRL-W_J*
CTRL-W J	Move the current window to be at the very bottom, using the
		full width of the screen.  This works like closing the current
		window and then creating another one with ":botright split",
		except that the current window contents is used for the new
		window.

						*CTRL-W_H*
CTRL-W H	Move the current window to be at the far left, using the
		full height of the screen.  This works like closing the
		current window and then creating another one with
		":vert topleft split", except that the current window contents
		is used for the new window.
		{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit| feature}

						*CTRL-W_L*
CTRL-W L	Move the current window to be at the far right, using the full
		height of the screen.  This works like closing the
		current window and then creating another one with
		":vert botright split", except that the current window
		contents is used for the new window.
		{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit| feature}

						*CTRL-W_T*
CTRL-W T	Move the current window to a new tab page.  This fails if
		there is only one window in the current tab page.
		When a count is specified the new tab page will be opened
		before the tab page with this index.  Otherwise it comes after
		the current tab page.
