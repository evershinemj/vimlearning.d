			If {cmd} contains "%" it is expanded to the current
			file name.  Special characters are not escaped, use
			quotes to avoid their special meaning: >
				:!ls "%"
<			If the file name contains a "$" single quotes might
			work better (but a single quote causes trouble): >
				:!ls '%'
<			This should always work, but it's more typing: >
				:exe "!ls " . shellescape(expand("%"))
