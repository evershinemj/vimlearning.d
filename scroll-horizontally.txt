4. Scrolling horizontally				*scroll-horizontal*

For the following four commands the cursor follows the screen.  If the
character that the cursor is on is moved off the screen, the cursor is moved
to the closest character that is on the screen.  The value of 'sidescroll' is
not used.

z<Right>    or						*zl* *z<Right>*
zl			Move the view on the text [count] characters to the
			right, thus scroll the text [count] characters to the
			left.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

z<Left>      or						*zh* *z<Left>*
zh			Move the view on the text [count] characters to the
			left, thus scroll the text [count] characters to the
			right.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

							*zL*
zL			Move the view on the text half a screenwidth to the
			right, thus scroll the text half a screenwidth to the
			left.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

							*zH*
zH			Move the view on the text half a screenwidth to the
			left, thus scroll the text half a screenwidth to the
			right.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in
			Vi}

For the following two commands the cursor is not moved in the text, only the
text scrolls on the screen.

							*zs*
zs			Scroll the text horizontally to position the cursor
			at the start (left side) of the screen.  This only
			works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in Vi}

							*ze*
ze			Scroll the text horizontally to position the cursor
			at the end (right side) of the screen.  This only
			works when 'wrap' is off.  {not in Vi}
