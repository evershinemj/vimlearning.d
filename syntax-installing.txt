*44.11*	Installing a syntax file

When your new syntax file is ready to be used, drop it in a "syntax" directory
in 'runtimepath'.  For Unix that would be "~/.vim/syntax".
  The name of the syntax file must be equal to the file type, with ".vim"
added.  Thus for the x language, the full path of the file would be:

	~/.vim/syntax/x.vim ~

You must also make the file type be recognized.  See |43.2|.
