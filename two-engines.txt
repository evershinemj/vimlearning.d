				*/\%#=* *two-engines* *NFA*
Vim includes two regexp engines:
1. An old, backtracking engine that supports everything.
2. A new, NFA engine that works much faster on some patterns, possibly slower
   on some patterns.

Vim will automatically select the right engine for you.  However, if you run
into a problem or want to specifically select one engine or the other, you can
prepend one of the following to the pattern:

	\%#=0	Force automatic selection.  Only has an effect when
	        'regexpengine' has been set to a non-zero value.
	\%#=1	Force using the old engine.
	\%#=2	Force using the NFA engine.

You can also use the 'regexpengine' option to change the default.

			 *E864* *E868* *E874* *E875* *E876* *E877* *E878*
If selecting the NFA engine and it runs into something that is not implemented
the pattern will not match.  This is only useful when debugging Vim.
