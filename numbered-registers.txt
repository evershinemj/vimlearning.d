2. Numbered registers "0 to "9		*quote_number* *quote0* *quote1*
					*quote2* *quote3* *quote4* *quote9*
Vim fills these registers with text from yank and delete commands.
   Numbered register 0 contains the text from the most recent yank command,
unless the command specified another register with ["x].
   Numbered register 1 contains the text deleted by the most recent delete or
change command, unless the command specified another register or the text is
less than one line (the small delete register is used then).  An exception is
made for the delete operator with these movement commands: |%|, |(|, |)|, |`|,
|/|, |?|, |n|, |N|, |{| and |}|.  Register "1 is always used then (this is Vi
compatible).  The "- register is used as well if the delete is within a line.
Note that these characters may be mapped.  E.g. |%| is mapped by the matchit
plugin.
   With each successive deletion or change, Vim shifts the previous contents
of register 1 into register 2, 2 into 3, and so forth, losing the previous
contents of register 9.
