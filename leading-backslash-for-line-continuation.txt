							*line-continuation*
Long lines in a ":source"d Ex command script file can be split by inserting
a line continuation symbol "\" (backslash) at the start of the next line.
There can be white space before the backslash, which is ignored.

Example: the lines >
	:set comments=sr:/*,mb:*,el:*/,
		     \://,
		     \b:#,
		     \:%,
		     \n:>,
		     \fb:-
are interpreted as if they were given in one line:
	:set comments=sr:/*,mb:*,el:*/,://,b:#,:%,n:>,fb:-

All leading whitespace characters in the line before a backslash are ignored.
Note however that trailing whitespace in the line before it cannot be
inserted freely; it depends on the position where a command is split up
whether additional whitespace is allowed or not.

When a space is required it's best to put it right after the backslash.  A
space at the end of a line is hard to see and may be accidentally deleted. >
	:syn match Comment
		\ "very long regexp"
		\ keepend

There is a problem with the ":append" and ":insert" commands: >
   :1append
   \asdf
   .
The backslash is seen as a line-continuation symbol, thus this results in the
command: >
   :1appendasdf
   .
To avoid this, add the 'C' flag to the 'cpoptions' option: >
   :set cpo+=C
   :1append
   \asdf
   .
   :set cpo-=C

Note that when the commands are inside a function, you need to add the 'C'
flag when defining the function, it is not relevant when executing it. >
   :set cpo+=C
   :function Foo()
   :1append
   \asdf
   .
   :endfunction
   :set cpo-=C

Rationale:
	Most programs work with a trailing backslash to indicate line
	continuation.  Using this in Vim would cause incompatibility with Vi.
	For example for this Vi mapping: >
		:map xx  asdf\
<	Therefore the unusual leading backslash is used.
