*44.12*	Portable syntax file layout

Wouldn't it be nice if all Vim users exchange syntax files?  To make this
possible, the syntax file must follow a few guidelines.

Start with a header that explains what the syntax file is for, who maintains
it and when it was last updated.  Don't include too much information about
changes history, not many people will read it.  Example: >

	" Vim syntax file
	" Language:	C
	" Maintainer:	Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>
	" Last Change:	2001 Jun 18
	" Remark:	Included by the C++ syntax.

Use the same layout as the other syntax files.  Using an existing syntax file
as an example will save you a lot of time.
