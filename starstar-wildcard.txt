					*starstar-wildcard*
Expanding "**" is possible on Unix, Win32, Mac OS/X and a few other systems.
This allows searching a directory tree.  This goes up to 100 directories deep.
Note there are some commands where this works slightly differently, see
|file-searching|.
Example: >
	:n **/*.txt
Finds files:
	aaa.txt ~
	subdir/bbb.txt ~
	a/b/c/d/ccc.txt ~
When non-wildcard characters are used right before or after "**" these are
only matched in the top directory.  They are not used for directories further
down in the tree. For example: >
	:n /usr/inc**/types.h
Finds files:
	/usr/include/types.h ~
	/usr/include/sys/types.h ~
	/usr/inc/old/types.h ~
Note that the path with "/sys" is included because it does not need to match
"/inc".  Thus it's like matching "/usr/inc*/*/*...", not
"/usr/inc*/inc*/inc*".
