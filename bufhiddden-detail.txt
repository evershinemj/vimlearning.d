						*'bufhidden'* *'bh'*
'bufhidden' 'bh'	string (default: "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
	This option specifies what happens when a buffer is no longer
	displayed in a window:
	  <empty>	follow the global 'hidden' option
	  hide		hide the buffer (don't unload it), also when 'hidden'
			is not set
	  unload	unload the buffer, also when 'hidden' is set or using
			|:hide|
	  delete	delete the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bdelete|
	  wipe		wipe out the buffer from the buffer list, also when
			'hidden' is set or using |:hide|, like using
			|:bwipeout|

	CAREFUL: when "unload", "delete" or "wipe" is used changes in a buffer
	are lost without a warning.  Also, these values may break autocommands
	that switch between buffers temporarily.
	This option is used together with 'buftype' and 'swapfile' to specify
	special kinds of buffers.   See |special-buffers|.
