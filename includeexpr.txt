						*'includeexpr'* *'inex'*
'includeexpr' 'inex'	string	(default "")
			local to buffer
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+find_in_path| or |+eval| features}
	Expression to be used to transform the string found with the 'include'
	option to a file name.  Mostly useful to change "." to "/" for Java: >
		:set includeexpr=substitute(v:fname,'\\.','/','g')
<	The "v:fname" variable will be set to the file name that was detected.

	Also used for the |gf| command if an unmodified file name can't be
	found.  Allows doing "gf" on the name after an 'include' statement.
	Also used for |<cfile>|.

	The expression will be evaluated in the |sandbox| when set from a
	modeline, see |sandbox-option|.

	It is not allowed to change text or jump to another window while
	evaluating 'includeexpr' |textlock|.
