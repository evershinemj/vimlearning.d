1. Introduction					*windows-intro* *window*

Summary:
   A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
   A window is a viewport on a buffer.
   A tab page is a collection of windows.

A window is a viewport onto a buffer.  You can use multiple windows on one
buffer, or several windows on different buffers.

A buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing.  The original file remains
unchanged until you write the buffer to the file.

A buffer can be in one of three states:

							*active-buffer*
active:   The buffer is displayed in a window.  If there is a file for this
	  buffer, it has been read into the buffer.  The buffer may have been
	  modified since then and thus be different from the file.
							*hidden-buffer*
hidden:   The buffer is not displayed.  If there is a file for this buffer, it
	  has been read into the buffer.  Otherwise it's the same as an active
	  buffer, you just can't see it.
							*inactive-buffer*
inactive: The buffer is not displayed and does not contain anything.  Options
	  for the buffer are remembered if the file was once loaded.  It can
	  contain marks from the |viminfo| file.  But the buffer doesn't
	  contain text.

In a table:

state		displayed	loaded		":buffers"  ~
		in window			shows	    ~
active		  yes		 yes		  'a'
hidden		  no		 yes		  'h'
inactive	  no		 no		  ' '

Note: All CTRL-W commands can also be executed with |:wincmd|, for those
places where a Normal mode command can't be used or is inconvenient.

The main Vim window can hold several split windows.  There are also tab pages
|tab-page|, each of which can hold multiple windows.
					*window-ID* *winid* *windowid*
Each window has a unique identifier called the window ID.  This identifier
will not change within a Vim session. The |win_getid()| and |win_id2tabwin()|
functions can be used to convert between the window/tab number and the
identifier.  There is also the window number, which may change whenever
windows are opened or closed, see |winnr()|.

Each buffer has a unique number and the number will not change within a Vim
session.  The |bufnr()| and |bufname()| functions can be used to convert
between a buffer name and the buffer number.
