type {char} to avoid mapping
e.g. {

when a command disables input, the cause might be that it executes
a time-consuming sub-command, like shell command `find`

to make the input normal again, type CTRL-C

before executing :argadd, make sure the current directory is right

execute :cd % to enter the right directory if a directory is passed as 
an arg to vim (namely in netrw mode)

if the current directory is in the upper part of directory hierarchy,
:argadd **/... will result in too many args!

when 'complete' includes many buffers or files, it is better to use i_CTRL-X_CTRL-I for completion
