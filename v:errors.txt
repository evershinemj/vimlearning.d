					*v:errors* *errors-variable*
v:errors	Errors found by assert functions, such as |assert_true()|.
		This is a list of strings.
		The assert functions append an item when an assert fails.
		To remove old results make it empty: >
	:let v:errors = []
<		If v:errors is set to anything but a list it is made an empty
		list by the assert function.
